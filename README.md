# Yet another minecraft networking library

Well, we needed an 1.19.2 minecraft networking library for c# sooooo there it is.
Its available on nuget so feel free to use it yourself. We will not provide any documentation for now.
If you want to have some example code have a look at our Join2Start system.

This projects uses the great work from the minesharp project (https://github.com/psu-de/MineSharp) to generate the packet classes and communicating with the server.
This library is a reduced version of the MineSharp Bot system to make it easier to use as a network library
